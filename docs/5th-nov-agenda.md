**Knowledge Retention**: Ensuring documentation can serve as a persistent resource.

**Accountability and Improvement**: Enhancing processes and clarifying roles to encourage accountability.

#### 3. Discussion on Current Pain Points (15 minutes)

Specific input from new members:

What would have improved their onboarding process?

Are there particular resources or workflows that are missing or unclear?

#### 4. Content Structuring and Documentation Plan (20 minutes)

**Core Structure for Each Circle**:

Discuss the potential structure for documenting each Circle:

Overview of each Circle?s mission and objectives.

Member roles and responsibilities.

Detailed workflows and operational processes.

**Module-Based Approach**:

Build and document one Circle's overview, then replicate the approach for each Circle.

Align on consistent templates and format for easy maintenance.

#### 5. Onboarding Guide as a Priority Resource (10 minutes)

Discuss creating an onboarding guide for new members, based on feedback from Circle members.

Where to start.

How to access resources and documentation.

Overview of roles and responsibilities within Circles is very dynamic.

#### 6. Next Steps and Immediate Action Items (15 minutes)

**Setting up the Repository and Migration**:

Confirm that the MkDocs instance is ready to be used as a repository for the documentation.

Plan the conversion of existing pages.

**Assign Initial Tasks**:

Divide tasks such as:

Migrating existing documentation.

Documenting existing workflows for each Circle.

Drafting an initial template for onboarding documentation.

**Assign Leads** for each Circle if possible, so each Circle has a point of contact for documentation.

#### 7. Q&A and Open Discussion (5-10 minutes)

#### 8. Closing Remarks (5 minutes)

Recap action items and immediate next steps.

Schedule the next meeting and agree on follow-up communication channels.

### Key Points to Emphasize in the Meeting

**User-Focused Approach**: Reinforce that the primary ?users? of the documentation are Circle members.

**Iterative Development**: Encourage continuous improvement rather than perfect documentation right away.

**Collaboration Across Circles**: Make it clear that input from all Circles is essential to create documentation that truly supports each Circle?s unique needs.
