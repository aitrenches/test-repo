# TRACKER: 
📅 Documentation Circle – Bi-Weekly Meeting Agenda  
**Date:** Tuesday, October 7th, 2025  
**Time:** 1PM UTC  
**Host:** Anthony  

1. **Welcome and Recap (5 mins)**  
   Quick review of September 16th meeting outcomes.  
   Follow up on pending actions:  
   - Budget projection decisions.  
   - Progress on liaison Google Docs. How do we track their updates and everything new they have to add to their landing. The circles/resource will be enabled with training materials so they can update their resources themselves.  
   - MkDocs automation requirements draft.  

2. **Marketing & Events Collaboration: Educational Content Initiative (20 mins)**  
   **Objective:** Discuss Documentation Circle’s potential role in the new cross-circle educational initiative led by Marketing and Events.  
   **Background Summary:**  
   Jan and Rafael have proposed an educational and informational series (“All Things DEEP”) to build understanding around Deep Funding initiatives.  
   The concept includes a content rhythm (e.g., weekly videos, blogs, and AMAs) that will be stored in a searchable, growing knowledge repository—potentially becoming a “Wikipedia for Deep Funding.”  

   1. Who is the audience?  
   2. Who is the audience of the searchable growing knowledge repository, PROPOSERS, REVIEWERS.  
   3. Will there be an update schedule? Will it be updateable content or it’s a fixed set of content? This will affect how they are stored. YES, INTERNAL DECISION ON SCHEDULE  
   4. Or - is it a Wiki? So, collaborative, ongoing updates? (very different approach from a top-down SSOT - it’s a sort of collaborative SSOT) YES  
   5. What formats will material be in?  
   6. What is the time frame? Is it a 3 months initiative CONTINUOUS  
   7. See if Jan is talking about a Wiki, is that what he means? i.e. ongoing, collaborative updating?  
      Cos this is one of the things about SSOT - it's a really different ethos from the Wiki ethos and more decentralized  
   8. Anthony & Princess will attend the meeting.  
   9. Budget implications  
   10. We need to know the whole scope.  

   Documentation Circle is invited to support content organization, indexing, and standardization for this repository.  
   **Discussion Points:**  
   - How the Documentation Circle can contribute (structure, metadata, repository setup, long-term maintenance).  
   - Potential integration with the MkDocs automation and SSOT framework.  
   - Decide on who will represent the Circle at Thursday’s 13:00 UTC call with Jan and Rafael DN.
