**Preliminary Scoping Document for Instructions Documentation of Backend Systems**

**Date:** January 14, 2025 **Prepared for:** Rafael and Current Stake Handlers **Prepared by:** DF Documentation Work Group

### Background

Following discussions during the DF Documentation Work Group meeting, it was proposed that this group extend its responsibilities to include documentation for backend systems, examples are:

**The Community Portal**

**Main Website**

**Proposal Submission Tool**

**Operations System**

**Others**

We have outlined the preliminary scoping for this task, including the scope of responsibilities, strategy, potential challenges, mitigation approaches, and next steps.

### Scope of Responsibilities

We think the expanded responsibilities would involve:

**Understanding Current Backend Systems**

Engaging with the teams and individuals currently maintaining these backend systems.

Gathering existing documentation, technical inputs, and insights from the developers and operators.

**Developing Documentation Infrastructure**

Using a documentation framework of choice, to build scalable, user-friendly documentation resources for each backend system.

Structuring the documentation to allow ease of navigation and updates.

**Facilitating Consistent Updates**

Creating processes to enable system operators and developers to contribute updates to the documentation.

Ensuring documentation remains accurate and up-to-date with system changes.

**Supporting Backend Documentation Creation**

Option A: Closely collaborating with developers, operators and users to determine their unique documentation use cases (e.g User perspectives & Privacy concerns) then create initial structure/architecture for the documentation resource. Establish a pathway for continuous integration and continuous deployment

Option B: Option A + research, publishing, maintenance and management of the documentation resource.

### Documentation Strategy we plan to use

**Initial Scoping and Planning**

Meet with the current operators and developers to gather requirements and unique use cases.

Identify key areas of each system that require documentation (e.g., setup, workflows, APIs, troubleshooting guides).

**Documentation Structure**

Develop a uniform structure across all backend documentation resources for proper management and to ensure consistency.

Include sections for:

System Overview

Key Features and Functions

Technical Setup

User Guides & Video Walkthroughs

FAQs and Troubleshooting

Update and Maintenance Logs

**Collaboration and Feedback**

Work in tandem with the technical teams to validate the accuracy of the documentation.

Create feedback loops to continuously improve content quality.

User testing with non technical users

### Potential Challenges and Proposed Solutions

**Expertise and Time Constraints**

**Challenge:** Limited technical expertise within the work group may hinder understanding of backend systems.

**Solution:**

Invite skilled individuals with relevant technical backgrounds to join the Work Group.

Establish close collaboration with current developers and maintainers to leverage their expertise during the documentation process.

**Responsibility Assignment and Consistency**

**Challenge:** Ensuring documentation consistency and accountability for updates.

**Solution:**

Build robust infrastructure for MkDocs, making it easy for operators and developers to update content.

Develop guidelines and best practices for creating and maintaining documentation.

### Feasibility Considerations

While this added responsibility aligns with the group?s goals, concerns remain about the feasibility of taking on backend documentation tasks without additional resources. If the challenges we outlined above are addressed, then the Work Group will have the capacity to get it to handle the task.

### Proposed Next Steps

**Gather Initial Feedback**

Share this scoping document with Rafael Presa and the current stakeholders/handlers of the backend systems for their input.

Confirm their willingness to collaborate and contribute to the documentation process.

Present this in the half yearly and send to Mayor

**Define Roles and Responsibilities**

Determine whether the work group will:

Take full ownership of documentation creation and maintenance.

Focus on building infrastructure and processes for the current handlers to manage content.

**Develop a Pilot Plan**

Choose one system (e.g., Community Portal) as a pilot project to develop and test the documentation process.

Evaluate challenges, solutions, and outcomes to refine the approach for other systems.

**Resource Allocation**

Identify additional resources required (e.g., technical experts, tools) and present them to stakeholders for approval.

**Set Milestones and Deadlines**

Establish a timeline for completing the pilot and rolling out documentation for the remaining systems.

### Conclusion

The DF Documentation Work Group is prepared to take on this expanded responsibility, contingent on addressing the identified challenges and ensuring the availability of necessary resources. The outlined strategy and next steps will provide a solid foundation for effective backend documentation that aligns with the group?s overall objectives.

We look forward to receiving feedback and working collaboratively to move forward.
