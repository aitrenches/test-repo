# Agenda for DF Circles Documentation Work Group Meeting

**Date:** Tuesday, 18th March 2025  
**Time:** 1:00 PM UTC  
**Present:** Anthony, Vani, Miss Hadi, Sucre n Spice, Tobias  

1. **Welcome and Recap (5 minutes)**
   - Brief welcome and summary of key points from the 11th March meeting.
   - Quick review of progress on assigned tasks.
   - We agreed we won’t have a documentation rota - we’ll just keep notes in this agenda doc, to reduce overhead.

2. **DF Book Updates & Review (15 minutes)**
   - Review the current DF Book MkDocs version: [https://df-circles.github.io/df-book/](https://df-circles.github.io/df-book/)
   - Breakdown of content sources:
     - Data from Jan’s Confluence page (About section).
     - Transferred content from the existing DF Book (GitBook).
   - Review and discuss updates required for outdated content.
   - Identify missing sections, such as onboarding guides and additional documentation.
   - Who is the main Audience? Quick start guides for Circle members, Potential Circle members, Awarded Teams, Proposers. Use this info to redesign the Landing page.
   - Useful Links Section (to be reviewed, include the community portal).
   - Organization of the About section content, including the content itself. (Vani)
   - Information hierarchy - headlines, and drilled-down info for those who are interested. At the moment it’s all muddled together.
   - Ensure that we think about someone’s journey thru the site - if they are getting detailed info about things that have not even been defined, you’ll lose their interest.
   - Conclude on the Review Circles MkDocs (Anthony).
   - Vani will draft some kind of info hierarchy this week (if not done by next meeting, will hand it over).
   - Prepare the All Hands Meeting (next week Wednesday) report using the template. (Anthony)
   - Comments:
     - The first phrase on the homepage says "This documentation serves as your guide to understanding and participating in the DeepFunding ecosystem, whether you're an awarded team member, circle participant, or interested in learning more about our initiatives."
     - but we haven't even explained what a "Circle participant" is, or what "DeepFunding" even is…
     - Homepage needs to be a LOT cleaner and just have some basic introductory info in it.

**25th March 2024 Update:**
- Circles should appoint one member to update their MkDocs website resource.

**Action Items:**
- Reach out to Raphael to go through the new DF-Book (Sophia & Anthony).

3. **Proofreading & Landing Page Update (10 minutes)**

   - Feedback on the Home/Landing page curated by Love and [your name].
   - Discuss any structural improvements.

4. **Contribution Video & Documentation Process (10 minutes)**
   - Confirm the availability of the contribution video recording.
   - Discuss how to integrate it into the documentation process.
   - Plan for a written step-by-step contribution guide.

5. **Task Assignments & Action Items (15 minutes)**
