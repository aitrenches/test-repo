# Proposed Framework for Documentation

This is a simple framework to guide both the DeepFunding Circles documentation and Backend Systems documentation processes.

## 1. Preparation Phase

### Define Goals:
- Clarify what each documentation set aims to achieve (e.g., onboarding, system clarity, role explanation).

### Gather Existing Resources:
- Review existing documents (e.g., "Task recording sheet," "GitHub Board") to avoid duplication.

## 2. Gap Identification

### Interview Stakeholders:
- Meet with Circle leads or system operators to identify undocumented processes.

### Assess Current Documentation:
- Use the "Processes yet to be documented" column to track areas needing attention.

## 3. Documentation Strategy

### Standardize Templates:
- Create templates for both Circles and Backend Systems that include:
  - Overview
  - Step-by-step processes
  - Tools and resources
  - Troubleshooting/FAQs
- Example sections for Backend Systems: "System Overview," "API Details," "User Guide."

### Tailored Approaches:
- Adjust the framework for each Circle or system, based on complexity and size.

## 4. Collaboration and Input

### Feedback Loop:
- Work closely with Circle members and backend developers to validate drafts.

### Assign Liaisons:
- Each documentation effort is assigned a group member as a point of contact.

## 5. Content Creation

### Prioritize Critical Processes:
- Start with core workflows and high-impact areas.

### Iterative Development:
- Share drafts regularly to refine content before finalization.

## 6. Infrastructure and Tools

### Documentation Platform:
- Use MkDocs for hosting and organizing the content.
- Incorporate a search functionality for easy navigation.

### Version Control:
- Set up GitHub repositories for collaborative editing and version tracking.

## 7. Maintenance Plan

### Update Guidelines:
- Provide clear instructions for Circles and developers on how to update documentation.

### Review Schedule:
- Implement quarterly review cycles to ensure accuracy and relevance.
