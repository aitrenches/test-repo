### Proposed Framework for Documentation

This is a simple framework to guide both the **DeepFunding Circles documentation** and **Backend Systems documentation** processes.

#### 1. Preparation Phase

**Define Goals**:

Clarify what each documentation set aims to achieve (e.g., onboarding, system clarity, role explanation).

**Gather Existing Resources**:

Review existing documents (e.g., "Task recording sheet," "GitHub Board") to avoid duplication.

#### 2. Gap Identification

**Interview Stakeholders**:

Meet with Circle leads or system operators to identify undocumented processes.

**Assess Current Documentation**:

Use the "Processes yet to be documented" column to track areas needing attention.

#### 3. Documentation Strategy

**Standardize Templates**:

Create templates for both Circles and Backend Systems that include:

Overview

Step-by-step processes

Tools and resources

Troubleshooting/FAQs

Example sections for Backend Systems: "System Overview," "API Details," "User Guide."

**Tailored Approaches**:

Adjust the framework for each Circle or system, based on complexity and size.

#### 4. Collaboration and Input

**Feedback Loop**:

Work closely with Circle members and backend developers to validate drafts.

**Assign Liaisons**:

Each documentation effort is assigned a group member as a point of contact.

#### 

#### 5. Content Creation

**Prioritize Critical Processes**:

Start with core workflows and high-impact areas.

**Iterative Development**:

Share drafts regularly to refine content before finalization.

#### 6. Infrastructure and Tools

**Documentation Platform**:

Use MkDocs for hosting and organizing the content.

Incorporate a search functionality for easy navigation.

**Version Control**:

Set up GitHub repositories for collaborative editing and version tracking.

#### 7. Maintenance Plan

**Update Guidelines**:

Provide clear instructions for Circles and developers on how to update documentation.

**Review Schedule**:

Implement quarterly review cycles to ensure accuracy and relevance.
