   **Discussion Points:**  
   - What types of documentation are we targeting first?

   - How do we handle metadata, tagging, and hierarchy (based on Vani’s information structure)? Think about this when we have some data in there  
   - What kind of content review/approval flow is needed pre-upload? Mattermost reminders? Review cycle - how often? Monthly? Can we see that an update has been made?  
   - Coordination with other Circles: Who maintains what? Each circle maintains their own with support from one of us
