# Our Agenda for today will be a recap of last week's meeting and the action points.

1. Ideate on our very own requirements documents to get the MkDocs Automation to work for us first.
   - As yet we don’t know how to process images. Consider *not* using images - they are not searchable or indexable, and harder to update.
   - Structure will be based on Vani’s info hierarchy.
   - We will need to check content with the individual Circles.
   - **ACTION:** Anthony to create a walkthru video of the Gooogledoc to MKDocs process.

   RE Rafael’s doc on “single source of truth” - we will comment to suggest.  
   Question of who agrees/decides content for the SSOT? (decentralised approach).  
   Ideally need to cover lifecycle of docs - when do they become obsolete and who decides.  
   Maintenance cycles for existing documentation - establishing a schedule for updates, and do we as Documentation circle need to check if it’s done and chase people?

2. Love to help us with the tracking sheet for our internal management.

3. Update from our Documentation circle champion - Princess, working with the Onboarding circle to create our onboarding docs.

4. Discussion about the Proofreading initiative.
